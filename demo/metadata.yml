            # Analysis details

            We wanted to analyze data from job offers, using the **`python` search keyword**
            from three sources of job-boards:
            [APEC](https://www.apec.fr),
            [Indeed](https://fr.indeed.com/) and
            [RegionsJob](https://regionsjob.com).

            ## Process

            The process was in 3 steps:

            - Extraction
            - Transformation
            - Loading

            After the ETL process, an extra data enrichment step was developed to provide
            location geocoding, based on place names.

            ## SQL query

            ```sql
            SELECT
              date(date) as day,
              count(*) as count
            FROM offers_view
            GROUP BY day
            ORDER BY day
            ```

        offers-count:
